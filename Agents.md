## Issue Tracking

We use bd (beads) for issue tracking instead of Markdown TODOs or external tools.

bd - Dependency-Aware Issue Tracker

Issues chained together like beads.

CREATING ISSUES
  bd create "Fix login bug"
  bd create "Add auth" -p 0 -t feature
  bd create "Write tests" -d "Unit tests for auth" --assignee alice

VIEWING ISSUES
  bd list       List all issues
  bd list --status open  List by status
  bd list --priority 0  List by priority (0-4, 0=highest)
  bd show bd-1       Show issue details

MANAGING DEPENDENCIES
  bd dep add bd-1 bd-2     Add dependency (bd-2 blocks bd-1)
  bd dep tree bd-1  Visualize dependency tree
  bd dep cycles      Detect circular dependencies

DEPENDENCY TYPES
  blocks  Task B must complete before task A
  related  Soft connection, doesn't block progress
  parent-child  Epic/subtask hierarchical relationship
  discovered-from  Auto-created when AI discovers related work

READY WORK
  bd ready       Show issues ready to work on
            Ready = status is 'open' AND no blocking dependencies
            Perfect for agents to claim next work!

UPDATING ISSUES
  bd update bd-1 --status in_progress
  bd update bd-1 --priority 0
  bd update bd-1 --assignee bob

CLOSING ISSUES
  bd close bd-1
  bd close bd-2 bd-3 --reason "Fixed in PR #42"

DATABASE LOCATION
  bd automatically discovers your database:
    1. --db /path/to/db.db flag
    2. $BEADS_DB environment variable
    3. .beads/*.db in current directory or ancestors
    4. ~/.beads/default.db as fallback

AGENT INTEGRATION
  bd is designed for AI-supervised workflows:
    • Agents create issues when discovering new work
    • bd ready shows unblocked work ready to claim
    • Use --json flags for programmatic parsing
    • Dependencies prevent agents from duplicating effort

DATABASE EXTENSION
  Applications can extend bd's SQLite database:
    • Add your own tables (e.g., myapp_executions)
    • Join with issues table for powerful queries
    • See database extension docs for integration patterns:
      https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/EXTENDING.md

GIT WORKFLOW (AUTO-SYNC)
  bd automatically keeps git in sync:
    • ✓ Export to JSONL after CRUD operations (5s debounce)
    • ✓ Import from JSONL when newer than DB (after git pull)
    • ✓ Works seamlessly across machines and team members
    • No manual export/import needed!
  Disable with: --no-auto-flush or --no-auto-import

### Agent Session Workflow

**IMPORTANT for AI agents:** When you finish making issue changes, always run:

```bash
bd sync
```

This immediately:

1. Exports pending changes to JSONL (no 30s wait)
2. Commits to git
3. Pulls from remote
4. Imports any updates
5. Pushes to remote

**Example agent session:**

```bash
# Make multiple changes (batched in 30-second window)
bd create "Fix bug" -p 1
bd create "Add tests" -p 1
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress
bd close bd-40 --reason "Completed"

# Force immediate sync at end of session
bd sync

# Now safe to end session - everything is committed and pushed
```

**Why this matters:**

- Without `bd sync`, changes sit in 30-second debounce window
- User might think you pushed but JSONL is still dirty
- `bd sync` forces immediate flush/commit/push
